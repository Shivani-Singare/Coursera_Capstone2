To share the joy with patrons who end uprelishing the ambience, food and services is fulfilment of its own. \nHowever, only the owner knows what all efforts they have put in before opening up a restaurant. Developing and executing a solid business strategy for the restaurant is \nextremely important inorder to make the business successful.\n\nA perfect location has always been its major issue. Restaurants in heavily populated suburban areas or major cities face heavy competition.To overcome this issue,one should need a Data scientist who can analysis all the loactions of a particular city to open up a restaurant which can give proper business to the client.\n\nIn this case, I have chosen city London. We will consider an enterpreneur or a business man our client, who wish to open up a restaurant in London.we will predict some perfect locations for his business along with some general idea of cuisines for each particular location.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2. Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Getting started\n\nThe first thing you need to do is put a system in place for collecting area data through every channel possible. This should include List of areas of London \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London \" or List of London boroughs \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs \" or some where this can help \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_London \"; as long as you\u2019re collecting data, you\u2019re on the right path. After that, we will need some more data carrying the number of restaurants in london,probably this can help \"https://foursquare.com/holden_cfield/list/london-restaurants \".\n\n#### Make the data work for you\n\nOnce you\u2019ve collected as much data as possible, it\u2019s time to put that data to work for you. First and foremost, this requires that you ensure the data is \u201cclean\u201d\u2014removing corrupt or inaccurate records, and enabling your machine to process the data. It can be quite tedious and labor-intensive, but is absolutely vital. As the saying goes: \u201cBad data in. Bad data out.\u201d\n\nAfter cleaning the data you need to do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify high-level trends that you can examine further with specific models and algorithms. From there, you need to run and re-run your data against these models and algorithms to identify patterns and extract insights that may not be visible to the human eye. And then you rinse and repeat, gaining deeper and more valuable insights as the process goes on."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
