Canadian cuisine varies widely depending on the regions of the nation. The four earliest cuisines of Canada have indigenous, English, Scottish and French roots. The traditional cuisine of English Canada is closely related to British cuisine.\nThe traditional cuisine of French Canada has evolved from 16th-century French cuisine and the difficult conditions New France colonials and Coureur des bois faced. French Canadian cuisine is also now often divided into Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cuisine and Acadian cuisine.

Here we will provide a solution to this problem.\n\nHISTORY AND FOOD\n\nFrance and England battled over who would colonize the territory of Canada in the late 1400s. The English explorer John Cabot arrived in Newfoundland in 1497. About 40 years later in 1534, Jacques Cartier began his exploration of Canada on behalf of France. By the early 1600s, there were permanent French colonies, and in 1663, New France was established as a territory of France. French fur traders competed with the traders of the Hudson's Bay Company, run by British merchants. Wars in North America, known as the French and Indian wars, were waged in the 1700s. The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended the armed fighting and established British rule over all of the territory formerly called New France.\n\nCanada\n\nIn 1846 conflict over the western portion of the United States\u2013Canada border was resolved, and the border was set at 49\u00b0north latitude. This border has been undisputed every since.\n\nFood and other customs in Canada still carry hints of the colonial influences of England and France. Canadians speak English except in Quebec, where the language is French, reflecting the influence of French settlers. But there are other regional differences in food and customs, too.\n\nRead more: http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Canada.html#ixzz6vvqrKztK\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

We will chose if the goal is absolutely clear from the beginning (as in building construction) or it is not clear (as in research). Second, if the Solution process is definied and pre-establish or if process are ad-hoc and discovered in the way of developping the project.\nProject Characteristics Quadrants by Goal and Solution Uncertainty \u2014 Adapted from [1]\n\nType 1. Linear Strategy:\n\nA linear strategy consist in sequential phases with no feedback loops. The project solution is not released until the final phase is reached. This strategy is characterized by clearly defined goal solution and requirements, zero or few change request of the scope, routine and repetitive process inside the project, use of pre-established formulas and templates.\n\nType 1. Incremental Strategy:\n\nThis strategy is similar to linear strategy but each phase of the project releases a partial solution. In this strategy the value must be deliver before the final phase.\n\nType 1 or 2. Iterative Strategy (e.g. Scrum or Feature-Driven Development)\n\nTrying to fully map out and plan for an ever-changing environment is not efficient. Therefore, Agile encourages data-based, iterative decision making. For example, in Scrum, the primary focus is on delivering products that satisfy customer requirements in small iterative increments.\n\nSimilar to incremental strategy but consistent of a number of repeated phases. This strategy includes a feedback loop after a group of phases is completed. The loop stops when customer is satisfied, that is the strategy uses several intermediate solutions as a pathway to discover how the final solution should be.\n\nType 2 or 3. Adaptive Strategy (e.g. Adaptive Project Framework or Adaptive Software Development)\n\nSimilar to iterative strategy but each iteration feedback will adjust the future of project to converge over a complete solution. An iteration may create a partial solution to the customer. This strategy is adaptive because the final solution is only partially known by the customer, so the success depend on the ability to allocate frequent changes. Here planning is done in just-in-time manner. [2]\n\nType 4. Extreme Strategy (e.g. Research & Development projects)\n\nSimilar to adaptive strategy but each iteration feedback, the goal of the project must also be discover and the project will converge upon it. This is a type 4 strategy because nor is the goal or the solution process known. The level of uncertainty of goals and path in this kind of projects lead to high level of complexity. Usually final product is very different from what may be expected in the original intent."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
